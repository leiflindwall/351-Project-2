Instructions:

This project was written in C/C++ and is meant to be run in a UNIX-style command line terminal that supports GCC, Makefiles.

Type "make" in a terminal window in the folder that contains the code to compile the programs.

The Makefile will automatically run the executable, immediately prompting the user to enter the memory size.
Then the user will enter the page size as 1 digit, and will be asked for a workload file.  For testing, this was
"in1.txt".  The output of the simulation will be printed to the terminal.

To break out of the program in the terminal, press "CTRL-C".

To remove compiled object files, type "make clean" in the directory containing the files.
